/*
 * This file implementations integration between the GLib main loop and
 * the native system of the Core Foundation run loop and Cocoa event
 * handling. There are basically three different cases that we need to
 * handle:
 *
 * - the GLib main loop is in control. The application has called
 *   gtk_main(), or is otherwise iterating the main loop.
 * - CFRunLoop is in control. We are in a modal operation such as window
 *   resizing.
 * - CFRunLoop is running a nested loop. This happens when a drag-and-drop
 *   operation has been initiated.
 *
 * When the GLib main loop is in control we integrate in native event
 * handling in two ways: first we add a GSource that handles checking
 * whether there are native events available, translating native events
 * to GDK events, and dispatching GDK events. Second we replace the
 * "poll function" of the GLib main loop with our own version that knows
 * how to wait for both the file descriptors and timeouts that GLib is
 * interested in and also for incoming native events.
 *
 * When CFRunLoop is in control, we integrate in GLib main loop handling
 * by adding a "run loop observer" that gives us notification at various
 * points in the run loop cycle. We map these points onto the corresponding
 * stages of the GLib main loop (prepare, check, dispatch), and make the
 * appropriate calls into GLib.
 *
 * When initiating a drag operation, a nested CFRunLoop is executed.
 * The nested run loop is started when fetching a native event in our GLib
 * main loop. The application does not receive any events until the nested loop
 * is finished. We work around this by forwarding the
 * events that trigger the callbacks of the NSDraggingSource protocol.
 * The "run loop observer" is executing the GLib main loop stages as long as we're
 * in the nested run loop, as if CFRunLoop were in control.
 * See also GdkMacosWindow.
 *
 * All cases share a single problem: the macOS API’s don’t allow us to
 * wait simultaneously for file descriptors and for events. So when we
 * need to do a blocking wait that includes file descriptor activity, we
 * push the actual work of calling select() to a helper thread (the
 * "select thread") and wait for native events in the main thread.
 *
 * The main known limitation of this code is that if a callback is triggered
 * via the macOS run loop while we are "polling" (in either case described
 * above), iteration of the GLib main loop is not possible from within
 * that callback. If the programmer tries to do so explicitly, then they
 * will get a warning from GLib "main loop already active in another thread".
