/// #GtkGestureSingle is a subclass of #GtkGesture, optimized (although
/// not restricted) for dealing with mouse and single-touch gestures. Under
/// interaction, these gestures stick to the first interacting sequence, which
/// is accessible through gtk_gesture_single_get_current_sequence() while the
/// gesture is being interacted with.
///
/// By default gestures react to both %GDK_BUTTON_PRIMARY and touch
/// events, gtk_gesture_single_set_touch_only() can be used to change the
/// touch behavior. Callers may also specify a different mouse button number
/// to interact with through gtk_gesture_single_set_button(), or react to any
/// mouse button by setting 0. While the gesture is active, the button being
/// currently pressed can be known through gtk_gesture_single_get_current_button().
