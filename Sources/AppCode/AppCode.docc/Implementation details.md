# Implementation details

## Overview

You don't need to interact with any of this directly unless you're doing
something very advanced. Many of these are only exposed as `public` so that
advanced users don't have to reimplement helpers that we've already
implemented, and others are exposed to enable unique use-cases such as embedding
AppCode view graphs inside existing non-AppCode apps.

<!-- TODO: Write technical deep dives into some of these implementation details -->
