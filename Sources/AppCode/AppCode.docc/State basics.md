# State basics

## Overview

These concepts form the foundation of AppCode's reactivity.

Use the ``State`` property wrapper to store state within your apps, scenes,
and views. State generally trickles down through your view hierarchies. Variables
without the ``State`` annotation aren't reactive.

For situations where you need data to trickle back up again, use ``Binding``
(think mutable references to state).
