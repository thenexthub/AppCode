/// The Connection Packet Type Changed event is used to indicate that the process has completed of the Link Manager changing which packet types can be used for the connection. This allows current connections to be dynamically modified to support different types of user data. The Packet_Type event parameter specifies which packet types the Link Manager can use for the connection identified by the Connection_Handle event parameter for sending L2CAP data or voice. The Packet_Type event parameter does not decide which packet types the LM is allowed to use for sending LMP PDUs.
