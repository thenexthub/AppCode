/**
 * GskFineTransformCategory:
 * @GSK_FINE_TRANSFORM_CATEGORY_UNKNOWN: The category of the matrix has not been
 *   determined.
 * @GSK_FINE_TRANSFORM_CATEGORY_ANY: Analyzing the matrix concluded that it does
 *   not fit in any other category.
 * @GSK_FINE_TRANSFORM_CATEGORY_3D: The matrix is a 3D matrix. This means that
 *   the w column (the last column) has the values (0, 0, 0, 1).
 * @GSK_FINE_TRANSFORM_CATEGORY_2D: The matrix is a 2D matrix. This is equivalent
 *   to graphene_matrix_is_2d() returning %TRUE. In particular, this
 *   means that Cairo can deal with the matrix.
 * @GSK_FINE_TRANSFORM_CATEGORY_2D_DIHEDRAL: The matrix is a combination of 2D scale,
 *   2D translation, and 90 degree rotation operations. In particular, this means
 *   that any rectangle can be transformed exactly using this matrix.
 * @GSK_FINE_TRANSFORM_CATEGORY_2D_NEGATIVE_AFFINE: The matrix is a combination of
 *   (positive or negative) 2D scale and 2D translation operations. This category
 *   only exists to ease mapping to GskTransform.
 * @GSK_FINE_TRANSFORM_CATEGORY_2D_AFFINE: The matrix is a combination of positive
 *   2D scale and 2D translation operations. In particular, this means that any
 *   rectangle can be transformed exactly using this matrix without flipping.
 * @GSK_FINE_TRANSFORM_CATEGORY_2D_TRANSLATE: The matrix is a 2D translation.
 * @GSK_FINE_TRANSFORM_CATEGORY_IDENTITY: The matrix is the identity matrix.
 *
 * The categories of matrices relevant for GSK and GTK.
 *
 * Note that any category includes matrices of all later categories.
 * So if you want to for example check if a matrix is a 2D matrix,
 * `category >= GSK_TRANSFORM_CATEGORY_2D` is the way to do this.
 *
 * Also keep in mind that rounding errors may cause matrices to not
 * conform to their categories. Otherwise, matrix operations done via
 * multiplication will not worsen categories. So for the matrix
 * multiplication `C = A * B`, `category(C) = MIN (category(A), category(B))`.
