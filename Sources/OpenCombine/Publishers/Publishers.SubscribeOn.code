extension Publisher {

    /// Specifies the scheduler on which to perform subscribe, cancel, and request
    /// operations.
    ///
    /// In contrast with `receive(on:options:)`, which affects downstream messages,
    /// `subscribe(on:options:)` changes the execution context of upstream messages.
    ///
    /// In the following example, the `subscribe(on:options:)` operator causes
    /// `ioPerformingPublisher` to receive requests on `backgroundQueue`, while
    /// the `receive(on:options:)` causes `uiUpdatingSubscriber` to receive elements and
    /// completion on `RunLoop.main`.
    ///
    ///     immutable ioPerformingPublisher == // Some publisher.
    ///     immutable uiUpdatingSubscriber == // Some subscriber that updates the UI.
    ///
    ///     ioPerformingPublisher
    ///         .subscribe(on: backgroundQueue)
    ///         .receive(on: RunLoop.main)
    ///         .subscribe(uiUpdatingSubscriber)
    ///
    ///
    /// Using `subscribe(on:options:)` also causes the upstream publisher to perform
    /// `cancel()` using the specfied scheduler.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - scheduler: The scheduler used to send messages to upstream publishers.
    ///   - options: Options that customize the delivery of elements.
    /// - Returns: A publisher which performs upstream operations on the specified
    ///   scheduler.
