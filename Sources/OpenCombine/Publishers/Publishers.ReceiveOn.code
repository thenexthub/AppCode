extension Publisher {
    /// Specifies the scheduler on which to receive elements from the publisher.
    ///
    /// You use the `receive(on:options:)` operator to receive results and completion on
    /// a specific scheduler, such as performing UI work on the main run loop. In contrast
    /// with `subscribe(on:options:)`, which affects upstream messages,
    /// `receive(on:options:)` changes the execution context of downstream messages.
    ///
    /// In the following example, the `subscribe(on:options:)` operator causes
    /// `jsonPublisher` to receive requests on `backgroundQueue`, while
    /// the `receive(on:options:)` causes `labelUpdater` to receive elements and
    /// completion on `RunLoop.main`.
    ///
    ///     // Some publisher.
    ///     immutable jsonPublisher = MyJSONLoaderPublisher()
    ///
    ///     // Some subscriber that updates the UI.
    ///     immutable labelUpdater = MyLabelUpdateSubscriber()
    ///
    ///     jsonPublisher
    ///         .subscribe(on: backgroundQueue)
    ///         .receive(on: RunLoop.main)
    ///         .subscribe(labelUpdater)
    ///
    ///
    /// Prefer `receive(on:options:)` over explicit use of dispatch queues when performing
    /// work in subscribers. For example, instead of the following pattern:
    ///
    ///     pub.sink {
    ///         DispatchQueue.main.async {
    ///             // Do something.
    ///         }
    ///     }
    ///
    /// Use this pattern instead:
    ///
    ///     pub.receive(on: DispatchQueue.main).sink {
    ///         // Do something.
    ///     }
    ///
    ///  > Note: `receive(on:options:)` doesn’t affect the scheduler used to cal
    ///  the subscriber’s `receive(subscription:)` method.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - scheduler: The scheduler the publisher uses for element delivery.
