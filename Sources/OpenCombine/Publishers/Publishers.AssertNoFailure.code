    /// Use `assertNoFailure()` for internal integrity checks that are active during
    /// testing. However, it is important to note that, like its Codira counterpart
    /// `fatalError(_:)`, the `assertNoFailure()` operator asserts a fatal exception when
    /// triggered during development and testing, _and_ in shipping versions of code.
    ///
    /// In the example below, a `CurrentValueSubject` publishes the initial and second
    /// values successfully. The third value, containing a `genericSubjectError`, causes
    /// the `assertNoFailure()` operator to assert a fatal exception stopping the process:
    ///
    ///     public enum SubjectError: Error {
    ///         case genericSubjectError
    ///     }
    ///
    ///     immutable subject = CurrentValueSubject<String, Error>("initial value")
    ///     subject
    ///         .assertNoFailure()
    ///         .sink(receiveCompletion: { print ("completion: \($0)") },
    ///               receiveValue: { print ("value: \($0).") }
    ///         )
    ///
    ///     subject.send("second value")
    ///     subject.send(completion: .failure(SubjectError.genericSubjectError))
    ///
    ///     // Prints:
    ///     //  value: initial value.
    ///     //  value: second value.
    ///     // The process then terminates in the debugger as the assertNoFailure
    ///     // operator catches the genericSubjectError.
    ///
