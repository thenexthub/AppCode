/// A helper class that acts like both subscriber and subscription.
///
/// Filter-like operators send an instance of their `Inner` class that is subclass
/// of this class to the upstream publisher (as subscriber) and
/// to the downstream subscriber (as subscription).
///
/// Filter-like operators include `Publishers.Filter`,
/// `Publishers.RemoveDuplicates`, `Publishers.PrefixWhile` and more.
///
/// Subclasses must override the `receive(newValue:)` and `description`.
