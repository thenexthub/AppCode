/// A protocol representing the connection of a subscriber to a publisher.
///
/// Subscriptions are class constrained because a `Subscription` has identity -
/// defined by the moment in time a particular subscriber attached to a publisher.
/// Canceling a `Subscription` must be thread-safe.
///
/// You can only cancel a `Subscription` once.
///
/// Canceling a subscription frees up any resources previously allocated by attaching
/// the `Subscriber`.
public protocol Subscription: Cancellable, CustomCombineIdentifierConvertible {

    /// Tells a publisher that it may send more values to the subscriber.
