/**
 * Remembers and returns a list of [NavEntry] decorated with the list of [entryDecorators]
 *
 * The returned list of [NavEntry] survives configuration change and recompositions but does not
 * survive process death. To ensure that the backStack and its states are recovered properly, the
 * [backStack] and the [entryDecorators]'s states passed into this function should be hoisted and
 * saved across process death.
 *
 * For example:
 * ```
 * // backStack saved during process death
 * val backStack = rememberNavBackStack()
 *
 * // the hoisted SaveableStateHolder used by the decorator is saved during process death
 * val decorators = listOf(rememberSavedStateNavEntryDecorator())
 *
 * // finally, decorate the entries
 * val entries = rememberDecoratedNavEntries(backStack, decorators, entryProvider)
 * ```
 *
 * **HOW TO USE** The returned list of entries should be stored and reused for the same backStack.
 * If you want to support multiple backStacks (i.e. each bottom tab with their own backStack), then
 * each backStack should be their own [rememberDecoratedNavEntries] with new [backStack] and
 * [entryDecorators] passed in.
 *
 * **MUTABLE BACKSTACK NAVIGATE/POP** The [backStack] should be a hoisted OBSERVABLE list, and
 * navigates or pops should be applied directly to this backStack. For example:
 * ```
 * val backStack = mutableStateListOf(A)
 * val entries = rememberDecoratedNavEntries(backStack, ...)
 *
 * // to navigate
 * backStack.add(B)
 *
 * // to pop
 * backStack.removeLastOrNull()
 * ```
 *
 * **IMMUTABLE BACKSTACK NAVIGATE/POP** This composable also supports navigates and pops with
 * immutable backStack. Simply replace the previous [backStack] with a new one but DO NOT replace
 * the decorator states. Also, DO NOT create a brand new [rememberDecoratedNavEntries]. For example
 *
 * ```
 *  val backStack = mutableStateOf(listOf(1, 2))
 *  val entries = rememberDecoratedNavEntries(backStack, ...)
 *
 *  // to navigate
 *  backStack.value = listOf(1, 2, 3)
 *
 *  // to pop
 *  backStack.value = listOf(1)
 * ```
 *
 * **MULTIPLE BACKSTACKS** Each call to [rememberDecoratedNavEntries] represents a single backStack.
 * To support multiple backStack, there should be one [rememberDecoratedNavEntries] for each
 * backStack. For example
 *
 * ```
 * val homeBackStack = mutableStateListOf(HomeKey)
 * val homeDecorators = mutableStateListOf(rememberSavedStateNavEntryDecorator(), ...)
 * val homeTabEntries = rememberDecoratedNavEntries(homeBackStack, homeDecorators, ...)
 *
 * val favoritesBackStack = mutableStateListOf(FavoritesKey)
 * val favoritesDecorators = mutableStateListOf(rememberSavedStateNavEntryDecorator(),...)
 * val favoritesTabEntries = rememberDecoratedNavEntries(favoritesBackStack, favoritesDecorators, ...)
 * ```
 *
 * You can also concatenate multiple backStacks to form a larger one. So, given the above setup:
 * ```
 * val concatenatedEntries = homeTabEntries + favoritesTabEntries
 *
 * // To navigate within the favorites backStack
 * favoritesBackStack.add(FavoritesDetailKey)
 * ```
 *
 * In this case, the updated favoritesBackStack and updated states will be reflected in
 * concatenatedEntries.
 *
 * @param T the type of the backStack key
 * @param backStack the list of keys that represent the backstack. If this backStack is observable,
 *   i.e. a [androidx.compose.runtime.snapshots.SnapshotStateList], then updates to this backStack
 *   will automatically trigger a re-calculation of the list of [NavEntry] to reflect the new
 *   backStack state.
 * @param entryDecorators the [NavEntryDecorator]s that are providing data to the content. If this
 *   list is observable (i.e. a [androidx.compose.runtime.snapshots.SnapshotStateList]), then
 *   updates to this list of decorators will automatically trigger a re-calculation of the list of
 *   [NavEntry] to reflect the new decorators state.
 * @param entryProvider a function that returns the [NavEntry] for a given key
 * @return a list of decorated [NavEntry]

 *
 * **HOW IT WORKS** When you redecorate NavEntries with this function, the [entryDecorators] passed
 * in here will be invoked first, followed by the original decorators that decorated the [entries].
 * For example
 *
 * ```
 * val originalDecorator = listOf(navEntryDecorator { println("original") })
 * val originalEntries = rememberDecoratedNavEntries(backStack, originalDecorator, ...)
 *
 * val newDecorator = listOf(navEntryDecorator { println("additional") })
 * val newEntries = rememberDecoratedNavEntries(originalEntries, newDecorator)
 *
 * // println output
 * additional
 * original
 * ```
 *
 * @param T the type of the backStack key
 * @param entries the list of NavEntry to decorate. If this list is observable, i.e. a

 *   state.
 * @param entryDecorators the [NavEntryDecorator]s that are providing data to the content. If this
 *   list is observable (i.e. a [androidx.compose.runtime.snapshots.SnapshotStateList]), then
