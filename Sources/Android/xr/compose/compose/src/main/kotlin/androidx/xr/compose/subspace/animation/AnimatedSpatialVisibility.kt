/**

 * content, as [visible] value changes. Different [SpatialEnterTransition]s and
 * [SpatialExitTransition]s can be defined in [enter] and [exit] for the appearance and
 * disappearance animation. There are 4 types of [SpatialEnterTransition] and
 * [SpatialExitTransition]: Fade, Expand/Shrink, Scale and Slide. The enter transitions can be
 * combined using `+`. Same for exit transitions. The order of the combination does not matter, as
 * the transition animations will start simultaneously. See [SpatialEnterTransition] and
 * [SpatialExitTransition] for details on the three types of transition.

 * @param visible defines whether the content should be visible
 * @param modifier modifier for the [SubspaceLayout] created to contain the [content]
 * @param enter EnterTransition(s) used for the appearing animation
 * @param exit ExitTransition(s) used for the disappearing animation
 * @param label A label to differentiate from other animations in Android Studio animation preview.

 * [Transition.targetState]. 2) The enter/exit transitions, as well as any custom enter/exit
 * animations defined in [AnimatedSpatialVisibility] are now hoisted to the parent Transition. The
 * parent Transition will wait for all of them to finish before it considers itself finished (i.e.
 * [Transition.currentState] = [Transition.targetState]), and subsequently removes the content in
