/**
 * This base class offers logic to save the {@link DisplayData} it receives (without any heavy
 * contents) and restore it after a destroy/create cycle, including re-fetching (on a separate
 * thread) the actual contents from the saved data. In all cases, the actual contents are
 * delivered to the sub-class via {@link #onContentsAvailable} after its view hierarchy has been
 * built (after {@link #onCreateView}).
 * <p>
 * This class introduces one extra life-cycle callback:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #onContentsAvailable}, as explained above, will run after {@link #onCreateView} and
 *     deliver the full file contents.
 * </ul>
 * In order to work as expected, it requires the parent frame of the viewer to be created at the
 * time it's being restored (which means during Activity#onCreate).
