If the build failure is triggered by an error in a file generated by the build, diagnose-build-failure will attempt to identify which files have the error and should display them

  * You can also use diagnose-build-failure/impl/backup-state.sh to make a backup of your build state which you can later restore via diagnose-build-failure/impl/restore-state.sh
