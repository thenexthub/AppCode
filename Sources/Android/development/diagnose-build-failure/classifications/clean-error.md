If a clean build also reproduced the build failure, it may mean that everyone with this checkout is observing this issue

  A) This may mean that something about this checkout is different from others'

    You may be interested in checking the status of your checkout via `git status --recurse-submodules` and/or `repo status`

  B) You could check the build server to see if it is observing the same error (http://ab/androidx-main)

  C) You could ask some teammates if they're observing the same error

  D) You may be interested in running development/simplify-build-failure/simplify-build-failure.sh to identify the minimal set of source files required to reproduce this error
