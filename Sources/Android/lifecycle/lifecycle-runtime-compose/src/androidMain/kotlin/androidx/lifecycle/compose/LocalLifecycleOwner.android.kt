 * **Important:** For backward compatibility with Compose 1.6.*, we will use reflection to access
 * the [LocalLifecycleOwner] from the older `androidx.compose.ui.platform` package on Android
 * targets. This will be cached for efficiency and has a included custom Proguard rule to prevent
 * obfuscation issues.
 *
 * When using Compose 1.7.*, the [LocalLifecycleOwner] is directly accessed from the new package.
 *
 * Please note that backward compatibility reflection will be removed once Compose 1.7.* is stable.
 * A Gradle dependency constraint will be put in place to ensure smooth migration for clients.
