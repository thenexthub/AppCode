/**
 * A mutually exclusive advisory file lock implementation.
 *
 * The lock is cooperative and only protects the critical region from other [FileLock] users in
 * other process with the same `filename`. Do not use this class on its own, instead use
 * [ExclusiveLock] which guarantees in-process locking too.
 *
 * @param filename The path to the file to protect. Note that an actual lock is not grab on the file
 *   itself but on a temporary file create with the same path but ending with `.lck`.
