/**
 * An exclusive lock for in-process and multi-process synchronization.
 *
 * The lock is cooperative and only protects the critical region from other [ExclusiveLock] users
 * with the same `filename`. The lock is reentrant from within the same thread in the same process.
 *
 * Locking is done via two levels:
 * 1. Thread locking within the same process is done via a [ReentrantLock] keyed by the given
 *    `filename`.
 * 2. Multi-process locking is done via a [FileLock] whose lock file is based on the given
 *    `filename`.
 *
 * @param filename The path to the file to protect.
 * @param useFileLock Whether multi-process lock will be done or not.
