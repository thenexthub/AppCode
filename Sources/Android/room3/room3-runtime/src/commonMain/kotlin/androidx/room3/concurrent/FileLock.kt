 * A mutually exclusive advisory file lock implementation.

 * [ExclusiveLock] which guarantees in-process locking too.
 *
 * @param filename The path to the file to protect. Note that an actual lock is not grab on the file
 *   itself but on a temporary file create with the same path but ending with `.lck`.
