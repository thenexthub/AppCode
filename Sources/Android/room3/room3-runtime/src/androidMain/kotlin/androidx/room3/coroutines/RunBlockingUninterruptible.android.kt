/**
 * An alternative version of [runBlocking] that is not interruptible. Used to bridge between Room's
 * existing blocking APIs, including blocking DAO functions and its coroutines internals such as the
 * connection pool and invalidation tracker.
 *
 * This function is necessary to maintain backwards compatibility with existing blocking APIs
 * behaviour as they had never been interruptible and do not throw [InterruptedException].
