     * Called when the platform requests an [InputConnection] via [View.onCreateInputConnection].
     *
     * This method makes relatively stricter ordering guarantees about the lifetime of the returned
     * [InputConnection] than Android does, to make working with connections simpler. Namely, it
     * guarantees:
     * - References to an [InputConnection] will be cleared as soon as the connection get closed via
     *   [InputConnection.closeConnection]. Even if Android leaks its reference to the connection,
     *   the connection returned from this method will not be leaked.
     *
     * However it does not guarantee that only one [InputConnection] will ever be active at a time
     * for a given [PlatformTextInputMethodRequest] instance. On the other hand Android platform
     * does guarantee that even though the platform may create multiple [InputConnection]s, only one
     * of them will ever communicate with the app, invalidating any other [InputConnection] that
     * remained open at the time of communication.
     *
     * Android may call [View.onCreateInputConnection] multiple times for the same session â€“ each
     * system call will result in a 1:1 call to this method. Unfortunately Android platform may
     * decide to use an earlier [InputConnection] returned from this function, invalidating the ones
     * that were created later. Please do not rely on the order of calls to this function.
     *
     * @param outAttributes The [EditorInfo] from [View.onCreateInputConnection].
     * @return The [InputConnection] that will be used to talk to the IME as long as the session is
     *   active. This connection will not receive any calls after the requesting coroutine is
     *   cancelled.
