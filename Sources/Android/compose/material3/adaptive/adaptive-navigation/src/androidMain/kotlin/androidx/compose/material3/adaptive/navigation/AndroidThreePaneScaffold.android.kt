/**
 * A version of [ListDetailPaneScaffold] that supports navigation and predictive back handling out
 * of the box, controlled by [ThreePaneScaffoldNavigator].
 *
 * Example usage, including integration with the Compose Navigation library:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.material3.adaptive.samples.ListDetailWithNavigation2Sample
 * @param navigator The navigator instance to navigate through the scaffold.
 * @param listPane the list pane of the scaffold, which is supposed to hold a list of item summaries
 *   that can be selected from, for example, the inbox mail list of a mail app. See
 *   [ListDetailPaneScaffoldRole.List]. Note that we suggest you to use [AnimatedPane] as the root
 *   layout of panes, which supports default pane behaviors like enter/exit transitions.
 * @param detailPane the detail pane of the scaffold, which is supposed to hold the detailed info of
 *   a selected item, for example, the mail content currently being viewed. See
 *   [ListDetailPaneScaffoldRole.Detail]. Note that we suggest you to use [AnimatedPane] as the root
 *   layout of panes, which supports default pane behaviors like enter/exit transitions.
 * @param modifier [Modifier] of the scaffold layout.
 * @param extraPane the extra pane of the scaffold, which is supposed to hold any supplementary info
 *   besides the list and the detail panes, for example, a task list or a mini-calendar view of a
 *   mail app. See [ListDetailPaneScaffoldRole.Extra]. Note that we suggest you to use
 *   [AnimatedPane] as the root layout of panes, which supports default pane behaviors like
 *   enter/exit transitions.
 * @param defaultBackBehavior the default back navigation behavior when the system back event
 *   happens. See [BackNavigationBehavior] for the use cases of each behavior.
 * @param paneExpansionDragHandle the pane expansion drag handle to allow users to drag to change
 *   pane expansion state, `null` by default.
 * @param paneExpansionState the state object of pane expansion; when no value is provided but
 *   [paneExpansionDragHandle] is not `null`, a default implementation will be created for the drag
 *   handle to use.
