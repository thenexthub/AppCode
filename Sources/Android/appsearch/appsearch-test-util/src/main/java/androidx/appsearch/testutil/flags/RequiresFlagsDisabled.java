/**
 * Shim for real RequiresFlagsDisabled defined in Framework.
 *
 * <p>In Jetpack, this shim does nothing and exists only for code sync purpose.
 *
 * <p>In Framework, indicates that a specific test or class should be run only if all of the given
 * feature flags are disabled in the device's current state. Enforced by the {@code CheckFlagsRule}.
 *
 * <p>This annotation works together with {@link RequiresFlagsEnabled} to define the value that is
 * required of the flag by the test for the test to run. It is an error for either a method or class
 * to require that a particular flag be both enabled and disabled.
 *
 * <p>If the value of a particular flag is required (by either {@code RequiresFlagsEnabled} or
 * {@code RequiresFlagsDisabled}) by both the class and test method, then the values must be
 * consistent.
 *
 * <p>If the value of a one flag is required by an annotation on the class, and the value of a
 * different flag is required by an annotation of the method, then both requirements apply.
 *
 * <p>With {@code CheckFlagsRule}, test(s) will be skipped with 'assumption failed' when any of the
 * required flag on the target Android platform is enabled.
 *
 * <p>Both {@code SetFlagsRule} and {@code CheckFlagsRule} will fail the test if a particular flag
 * is both set (with {@code EnableFlags} or {@code DisableFlags}) and required (with {@code
 * RequiresFlagsEnabled} or {@code RequiresFlagsDisabled}).
