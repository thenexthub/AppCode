     * <p>Query strings can be empty, contain one term with no operators, or contain multiple

     *
     * <p>For query strings with a single term and no operators, documents that match the

     *
     * <p>The following operators are supported:
     *
     * <ul>
     *     <li>AND (implicit)
     *     <p>AND is an operator that matches documents that contain <i>all</i>
     *     provided terms.
     *     <p><b>NOTE:</b> A space between terms is treated as an "AND" operator. Explicitly
     *     including "AND" in a query string will treat "AND" as a term, returning documents that
     *     also contain "AND".
     *     <p>Example: "apple AND banana" matches documents that contain the
     *     terms "apple", "and", "banana".
     *     <p>Example: "apple banana" matches documents that contain both "apple" and
     *     "banana".
     *     <p>Example: "apple banana cherry" matches documents that contain "apple", "banana", and
     *     "cherry".
     *
     *     <li>OR
     *     <p>OR is an operator that matches documents that contain <i>any</i> provided term.
     *     <p>Example: "apple OR banana" matches documents that contain either "apple" or "banana".
     *     <p>Example: "apple OR banana OR cherry" matches documents that contain any of
     *     "apple", "banana", or "cherry".
     *
     *     <li>Exclusion (-)
     *     <p>Exclusion (-) is an operator that matches documents that <i>do not</i> contain the
     *     provided term.
     *     <p>Example: "-apple" matches documents that do not contain "apple".
     *
     *     <li>Grouped Terms
     *     <p>For queries that require multiple operators and terms, terms can be grouped into
     *     subqueries. Subqueries are contained within an open "(" and close ")" parenthesis.
     *     <p>Example: "(donut OR bagel) (coffee OR tea)" matches documents that contain
     *     either "donut" or "bagel" and either "coffee" or "tea".
     *
     *     <li>Property Restricts
     *     <p>For queries that require a term to match a specific {@link AppSearchSchema}
     *     property of a document, a ":" must be included between the property name and the term.
     *     <p>Example: "subject:important" matches documents that contain the term "important" in
     *     the "subject" property.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The above description covers the query operators that are supported on all versions of
     * AppSearch. Additional operators and their required features are described below.
     *
     * <p>{@link Features#LIST_FILTER_QUERY_LANGUAGE}: This feature covers the expansion of the
     * query language to conform to the definition of the list filters language (https://aip
     * .dev/160). This includes:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>addition of explicit 'AND' and 'NOT' operators</li>
     *     <li>property restricts are allowed with groupings (ex. "prop:(a OR b)")</li>
     *     <li>addition of custom functions to control matching</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The newly added custom functions covered by this feature are:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>createList(String...)</li>
     *     <li>search(String, {@code List<String>})</li>
     *     <li>propertyDefined(String)</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>createList takes a variable number of strings and returns a list of strings.
     * It is for use with search.
     *
     * <p>search takes a query string that will be parsed according to the supported
     * query language and an optional list of strings that specify the properties to be
     * restricted to. This exists as a convenience for multiple property restricts. So,
     * for example, the query `(subject:foo OR body:foo) (subject:bar OR body:bar)`
     * could be rewritten as `search("foo bar", createList("subject", "body"))`.
     *
     * <p>propertyDefined takes a string specifying the property of interest and matches all
     * documents of any type that defines the specified property
     * (ex. `propertyDefined("sender.name")`). Note that propertyDefined will match so long as
     * the document's type defines the specified property. Unlike the "hasProperty" function
     * below, this function does NOT require that the document actually hold any values for this
     * property.
     *
     * <p>{@link Features#NUMERIC_SEARCH}: This feature covers numeric search expressions. In the
     * query language, the values of properties that have
     * {@link AppSearchSchema.LongPropertyConfig#INDEXING_TYPE_RANGE} set can be matched with a
     * numeric search expression (the property, a supported comparator and an integer value).
     * Supported comparators are <, <=, ==, >= and >.
     *
     * <p>Ex. `price < 10` will match all documents that has a numeric value in its price
     * property that is less than 10.
     *
     * <p>{@link Features#VERBATIM_SEARCH}: This feature covers the verbatim string operator
     * (quotation marks).
     *
     * <p>Ex. `"foo/bar" OR baz` will ensure that 'foo/bar' is treated as a single 'verbatim' token.
     *
     * <p>{@link Features#LIST_FILTER_HAS_PROPERTY_FUNCTION}: This feature covers the
     * "hasProperty" function in query expressions, which takes a string specifying the property
     * of interest and matches all documents that hold values for this property. Not to be
     * confused with the "propertyDefined" function, which checks whether a document's schema
     * has defined the property, instead of whether a document itself has this property.
     *
     * <p>Ex. `foo hasProperty("sender.name")` will return all documents that have the term "foo"
     * AND have values in the property "sender.name". Consider two documents, documentA and
     * documentB, of the same schema with an optional property "sender.name". If documentA sets
     * "foo" in this property but documentB does not, then `hasProperty("sender.name")` will only
     * match documentA. However, `propertyDefined("sender.name")` will match both documentA and
     * documentB, regardless of whether a value is actually set.
     *
     * <p>{@link Features#LIST_FILTER_MATCH_SCORE_EXPRESSION_FUNCTION}: This feature covers the
     * "matchScoreExpression" function in query expressions.
     *
     * <p>Usage: matchScoreExpression({score_expression}, {low}, {high})
     * <ul>
     *     <li>matchScoreExpression matches all documents with scores falling within the
     *     specified range. These scores are calculated using the provided score expression,
     *     which adheres to the syntax defined in
     *     {@link SearchSpec.Builder#setRankingStrategy(String)}.</li>
     *     <li>"score_expression" is a string value that specifies the score expression.</li>
     *     <li>"low" and "high" are floating point numbers that specify the score range. The
     *     "high" parameter is optional; if not provided, it defaults to positive infinity.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Ex. `matchScoreExpression("this.documentScore()", 3, 4)` will return all documents that
     * have document scores from 3 to 4.
     *
     * <p>{@link Features#SCHEMA_EMBEDDING_PROPERTY_CONFIG}: This feature covers the
     * "semanticSearch" and "getEmbeddingParameter" functions in query expressions, which are
     * used for semantic search.
     *
     * <p>Usage: semanticSearch(getEmbeddingParameter({embedding_index}), {low}, {high}, {metric})
     * <ul>
     *     <li>semanticSearch matches all documents that have at least one embedding vector with
     *     a matching model signature (see {@link EmbeddingVector#getModelSignature()}) and a
     *     similarity score within the range specified based on the provided metric.</li>
     *     <li>getEmbeddingParameter({embedding_index}) retrieves the embedding search passed in
     *     {@link SearchSpec.Builder#addEmbeddingParameters} based on the index specified, which
     *     starts from 0.</li>
     *     <li>"low" and "high" are floating point numbers that specify the similarity score
     *     range. If omitted, they default to negative and positive infinity, respectively.</li>
     *     <li>"metric" is a string value that specifies how embedding similarities should be
     *     calculated. If omitted, it defaults to the metric specified in
     *     {@link SearchSpec.Builder#setDefaultEmbeddingSearchMetricType(int)}. Possible
     *     values:</li>
     *     <ul>
     *         <li>"COSINE"</li>
     *         <li>"DOT_PRODUCT"</li>
     *         <li>"EUCLIDEAN"</li>
     *     </ul>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Examples:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>Basic: semanticSearch(getEmbeddingParameter(0), 0.5, 1, "COSINE")</li>
     *     <li>With a property restriction:
     *     property1:semanticSearch(getEmbeddingParameter(0), 0.5, 1)</li>
     *     <li>Hybrid: foo OR semanticSearch(getEmbeddingParameter(0), 0.5, 1)</li>
     *     <li>Complex: (foo OR semanticSearch(getEmbeddingParameter(0), 0.5, 1)) AND bar</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>{@link Features#SEARCH_SPEC_SEARCH_STRING_PARAMETERS}: This feature covers the
     * "getSearchStringParameter" function in query expressions, which substitutes the string
     * provided at the same index in {@link SearchSpec.Builder#addSearchStringParameters} into the
     * query as plain text. This string is then segmented, normalized and stripped of
     * punctuation-only segments. The remaining tokens are then AND'd together. This function is
     * useful for callers who wish to provide user input, but want to ensure that that user input
     * does not invoke any query operators.
     *
     * <p>Usage: getSearchStringParameter({search_parameter_strings_index})
     *
     * <p>Ex. `foo OR getSearchStringParameter(0)` with {@link SearchSpec#getSearchStringParameters}
     * returning {"bar OR baz."}. The string "bar OR baz." will be segmented into "bar", "OR",
     * "baz", ".". Punctuation is removed and the segments are normalized to "bar", "or", "baz".
     * This query will be equivalent to `foo OR (bar AND or AND baz)`.

     * Retrieves suggested Strings that could be used as {@code queryExpression} in
     * {@link #search(String, SearchSpec)} API.
     *
     * <p>The {@code suggestionQueryExpression} can contain one term with no operators, or contain
     * multiple terms and operators. Operators will be considered as a normal term. Please see the
     * operator examples below. The {@code suggestionQueryExpression} must end with a valid term,
     * the suggestions are generated based on the last term. If the input
     * {@code suggestionQueryExpression} doesn't have a valid token, AppSearch will return an
     * empty result list. Please see the invalid examples below.
     *
     * <p>Example: if there are following documents with content stored in AppSearch.
     * <ul>
     *     <li>document1: "term1"
     *     <li>document2: "term1 term2"
     *     <li>document3: "term1 term2 term3"
     *     <li>document4: "org"
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Search suggestions with the single term {@code suggestionQueryExpression} "t", the
     * suggested results are:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>"term1" - Use it to be queryExpression in {@link #search} could get 3
     *     {@link SearchResult}s, which contains document 1, 2 and 3.
     *     <li>"term2" - Use it to be queryExpression in {@link #search} could get 2
     *     {@link SearchResult}s, which contains document 2 and 3.
     *     <li>"term3" - Use it to be queryExpression in {@link #search} could get 1
     *     {@link SearchResult}, which contains document 3.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Search suggestions with the multiple term {@code suggestionQueryExpression} "org t", the
     * suggested result will be "org term1" - The last token is completed by the suggested
     * String.
     *
     * <p>Operators in {@link #search} are supported.
     * <p><b>NOTE:</b> Exclusion and Grouped Terms in the last term is not supported.
     * <p>example: "apple -f": This Api will throw an
     * {@link androidx.appsearch.exceptions.AppSearchException} with
     * {@link AppSearchResult#RESULT_INVALID_ARGUMENT}.
     * <p>example: "apple (f)": This Api will return an empty results.
     *
     * <p>Invalid example: All these input {@code suggestionQueryExpression} don't have a valid
     * last token, AppSearch will return an empty result list.
     * <ul>
     *     <li>""      - Empty {@code suggestionQueryExpression}.
     *     <li>"(f)"   - Ending in a closed brackets.
     *     <li>"f:"    - Ending in an operator.
     *     <li>"f    " - Ending in trailing space.
