/**
 * Base class for handling navigation gestures dispatched by a [NavigationEventDispatcher].
 *
 * A [NavigationEventHandler] defines how an active component responds to system navigation gestures
 * (such as predictive back) and exposes the directional context needed to represent the appâ€™s
 * current navigation affordances:
 * - [backInfo]: Contextual information describing what is available when navigating back.
 * - [currentInfo]: The single active destination represented by this handler.
 * - [forwardInfo]: Contextual information describing what is available when navigating forward.
 *
 * Subclasses can override lifecycle methods (e.g., [onBackStarted], [onBackProgressed],
 * [onBackCompleted], [onBackCancelled], and their forward equivalents) to respond to gesture
 * progression and terminal outcomes.
 *
 * A handler must be registered with a [NavigationEventDispatcher] to receive events. It will only
 * be invoked while both the dispatcher and this handler are enabled.
 *
 * @param T The type of [NavigationEventInfo] associated with this handler.
 * @param initialInfo The initial value for [currentInfo].
 * @param isBackEnabled If `true`, this handler will process back navigation gestures.
 * @param isForwardEnabled If `true`, this handler will process forward navigation gestures.
 * @see NavigationEventDispatcher
 * @see NavigationEventInput
