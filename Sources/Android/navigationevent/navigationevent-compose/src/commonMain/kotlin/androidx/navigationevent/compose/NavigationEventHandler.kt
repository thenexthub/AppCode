/**
 * A composable that handles navigation events using simple lambda handlers, driven by a manually
 * hoisted [NavigationEventState].
 *
 * This is the core implementation of the navigation event handler. This overload must be used when
 * you need to hoist the [NavigationEventState] (by calling [rememberNavigationEventState] at a
 * higher level). Hoisting is necessary when other composables need to react to the gesture's
 * [NavigationEventTransitionState] (held within the `state` object), for example, to drive custom
 * animations.
 *
 * ## Precedence
 * When multiple [NavigationEventHandler] are present in the composition, the one that is composed
 * *last* among all enabled handlers will be invoked.
 *
 * ## Usage
 * It is important to call this composable **unconditionally**. Use [isBackEnabled] and
 * [isForwardEnabled] to control whether the handler is active. This is preferable to conditionally
 * calling [NavigationEventHandler] (e.g., inside an `if` block), as conditional calls can change
 * the order of composition, leading to unpredictable behavior where different handlers are invoked
 * after recomposition.
 *
 * ## Timing Consideration
 * There are cases where a predictive back or forward gesture may be dispatched within a rendering
 * frame before the corresponding `enabled` flag is updated, which can cause unexpected behavior
 * (see [b/375343407](https://issuetracker.google.com/375343407),
 * [b/384186542](https://issuetracker.google.com/384186542)). For example, if [isBackEnabled] is set
 * to `false`, a back gesture initiated in the same frame may still trigger this handler because the
 * system sees the stale `true` value.
 *
 * @param state The hoisted [NavigationEventState] (returned from [rememberNavigationEventState]) to
 *   be registered. This object links this handler's callbacks to the unique handler instance that
 *   is producing the state.
 * @param isForwardEnabled Controls whether forward navigation gestures are handled.
 * @param onForwardCancelled Called if a forward navigation gesture is cancelled.
 * @param onForwardCompleted Called when a forward navigation gesture completes.
 * @param isBackEnabled Controls whether back navigation gestures are handled.
 * @param onBackCancelled Called if a back navigation gesture is cancelled.
 * @param onBackCompleted Called when a back navigation gesture completes.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException If the provided [NavigationEventState] is passed to multiple
 *   [NavigationEventHandler] Composable. Each handler must have its own unique state.
