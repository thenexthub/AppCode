/**
 * Remembers and returns a [NavigationEventState] instance.
 *
 * This composable creates and remembers a [NavigationEventState] object, which holds a
 * [NavigationEventHandler] internally. This is the state object that can be passed to
 * [NavigationEventHandler] (the composable) to "hoist" the state.
 *
 * The state's handler info (currentInfo, backInfo, forwardInfo) is kept in sync with the provided
 * parameters via a [SideEffect].
 *
 * @param T The type of [NavigationEventInfo] this state will manage.
 * @param currentInfo The object representing the current destination.
 * @param backInfo A list of destinations the user may navigate back to (nearest-first).
 * @param forwardInfo A list of destinations the user may navigate forward to (nearest-first).
 * @return A stable, remembered [NavigationEventState] instance.
